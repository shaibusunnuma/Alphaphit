A fitness app created with Kotlin and Android Studio
This is my third app created with Android Studio and with Kotlin.
This app takes you through a series of workouts with illustrations within seven minutes.
It also has a BMI calculator to keep track of your progress using the app as well as a history of all your workouts.
After working on two android apps before this one, I realised there is always more to learn about even the smallest featues.
The main focus of this project was implementing databases with SQLite.
With no prior knowledge of SQL I was still able to implement databases on this app using wrapper Kotlin code.
Once again, the beauty of Kotlin and Android Studio.
As a mentor once told me,"Never estimate the power of consistency".
